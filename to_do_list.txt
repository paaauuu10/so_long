What is checking the program right now:
1. If the extension of the map is .ber
2. If the map is a rectangle
3. If perimeter's map is full of walls. Wall = 1!
4. If there are characters not valids inside the map. Only valid ones P, E, C, 0, 1
5. If there are more than one Exit(E) and one Player(P).
6. How many coins(C) are in the map, if less than one -> Error

What needs to check and it is not doing right now
1. Check if there is a solution to finish the game.
    1.a. Is it possibble to collect all the coins?
    1.b. Is it possible to leave?

Thinks that I need to do:
2. Player's position(row, col). (ALREADY DONE)
3. Exit's position(row, col).
