What is checking the program right now:
1. If the extension of the map is .ber
2. If the map is a rectangle
3. If perimeter's map is full of walls. Wall = 1!
4. If there are characters not valids inside the map. Only valid ones P, E, C, 0, 1
5. If there are more than one Exit(E) and one Player(P).
6. How many coins(C) are in the map, if less than one -> Error
7. Check if there is a solution to finish the game.
    7.a. Is it possibble to collect all the coins?
    7.b. Is it possible to leave?
8. Mlx implemented.
9. You can now play.
10. Limit the size of the screen.

Thinks that I need to do:
1. Seg fault changing the name of the image
2. Number of movements
